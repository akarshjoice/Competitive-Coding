// Question:
/*
Now, we'll try to solve a famous stack problem.
You are given an array A of size N. You need to first push the elements of the array into a stack and then print minimum in the stack at each pop.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A = {1 2 3 4 5}
Output: 
1 1 1 1 1
Explanation: 
After pushing elements to the stack, 
the stack will be "top -> 5, 4, 3, 2, 1". 
Now, start popping elements from the stack
popping 5: min in the stack is 1.popped 5
popping 4: min in the stack is 1. popped 4
popping 3: min in the stack is 1. popped 3
popping 2: min in the stack is 1. popped 2
popping 1: min in the stack is 1. popped 1
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 7
A = {1 6 43 1 2 0 5}
Output: 
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
Explanation: 
After pushing the elements to the stack, 
the stack will be 5->0->2->1->43->6->1. 
Now, poping the elements from the stack:
popping 5: min in the stack is 0. popped 5
popping 0: min in the stack is 0. popped 0
popping 2: min in the stack is 1. popped 2
popping 1: min in the stack is 1. popped 1
popping 43: min in the stack is 1. 
            popped 43
popping 6: min in the stack is 1. popped 6
popping 1: min in the stack is 1. popped 1.

 

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the provided functions _push() and _getMinAtPop(). The _push() function takes an array as parameter, you need to push all elements of this array onto a stack and return the stack. The _getMinAtPop() accepts a stack as a parameter which is returned by _push() function and prints minimum in the stack at each pop separated by spaces.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).


Constraints:
1 <= Ai <= 107
